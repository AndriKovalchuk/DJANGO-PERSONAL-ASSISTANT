### Django Project Group 9 - Personal Assistant

#### Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive personal assistant application using the Django framework. It includes various features such as file sorting, contact reminders, file uploading to cloud services, input validation, note editing and deletion, note search functionality, and authentication mechanisms.

1. **File Sorting by Categories**: Users can sort their files into categories (images, documents, videos, etc.) and view files based on selected categories.
   
2. **Birthday Reminders**: Displays a list of contacts whose birthdays fall within a specified number of days from the current date.
   
3. **Cloud File Uploading**: Users can upload files to cloud services and access them. The web interface allows users to upload any file to the server.
   
4. **Input Validation**: Validates phone numbers and email addresses during record creation or editing, providing feedback to users for incorrect inputs.
   
5. **Note Editing and Deletion**: Users can edit and delete notes.
